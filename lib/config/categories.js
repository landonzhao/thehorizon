/**
 * Controlled vocabulary: threat categories.
 *
 * Layer 5 (taxonomy) suggests category_candidates.
 * Layer 6 (classification) assigns exactly one main_category per source.
 *
 * The four offensive categories are the primary classification targets.
 * unclear_or_adjacent is the only fallback — used when no offensive category
 * applies with sufficient confidence.
 *
 * ai_for_security is retained as a LEGACY value only (for existing DB rows
 * ingested before the Layer 6 rework). It is not a valid output of Layer 6.
